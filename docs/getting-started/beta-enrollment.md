# Beta Enrollment

To get access to the beta access, you'll need to DM `Rexcantor64#7413` on Discord.

There are currently no restrictions on the number of beta testers.
However if a lot of people apply, priority will be given to those with issues that'll be fixed directly by beta versions.

After being accepted, you'll be required to create an account on [Polymart](https://polymart.org/) in order to download beta versions.
